      <p>You will find yourself in a little slice of heaven in the area that surrounds this quaint farm house!! Barren River Lake and State Park is just 10 miles away. Closer still is the charming town of Fountain Run, with it's hometown restaurants (home cooking and barbeque) and small town shops. Glasgow isn't far away with even more shopping and dining experiences! If you are coming to fish, Brownsford Boat Ramp is only 1 mile away. A short 45 minute drive will take you to Cave City where you can see Mammoth Cave, located on a beautiful state park. Cave City is also home to Funtown Mountain, great family fun just moments from state highway I-65! Kentucky Down Under isn't far from here either, another family attraction that will keep your family learning while on vacation!! Bowling Green, Ky is not too far as well, home of the world famous Corvette Museum. This is the only place in the world where Corvettes are built!! And Bowling Green has tons more shopping and the closest Starbucks! The nearest town is Scottsville, Ky, where you can find many restaurants, shopping and beautiful Mennonite/Amish communities for fresh vegetables, home made breads, plants, herbs and much more!!</p>
